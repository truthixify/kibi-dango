# ðŸ¥· Kibi Dango Puzzle Game â€” Dev Prompt & Architecture

This document contains structured prompts and key architecture notes for building the **Kibi Dango** puzzle game on **Starknet** using Cairo 1.0 smart contracts and a React frontend.

---

## ðŸ“œ Cairo Smart Contract Prompt

### Game Overview

Kibi Dango is a One Piece-inspired puzzle game. Players solve puzzles daily or from the community and earn `$KIBI` tokens. Their NFT pirate character upgrades based on total puzzles solved. All verification is done via on-chain hash commitments. The game runs on **Starknet**.

### Contracts To Build

#### 1. `KibiToken` (ERC20)
- Standard mintable ERC20
- Symbol: `$KIBI`
- Only the `PuzzleGame` contract can mint tokens

#### 2. `PirateNFT` (ERC721)
- Represents each pirate player
- Tracks:
  - `solves_count`
  - `rank`
- Auto-upgrades rank on solving milestone (10, 50, 100, 300, etc.)

#### 3. `PuzzleGame` Contract
- Anyone can create a puzzle by submitting a commitment: `hash(puzzle_id + solution + salt)`
- Optionally attach a $KIBI bounty
- Players can submit solution + salt
  - If hash matches and player hasnâ€™t solved it yet:
    - Mark player as solver
    - Mint $KIBI (daily or bounty)
    - Update `solves_count` and rank on NFT
